                <p>Hello! My name is Denny Le, I'm from Seattle, WA and I'm working towards becoming a professional programmer. <br> My journey in programming just started this year when I began taking classes at Epicodus. I chose to pursue programming because I want a career where I'll able to utilize my creativity, but will also push me to continue learning new skills. <br> I didn't have any background in coding or programming prior to Epicodus. I work as an actor and singer. I studied Musical Theatre at the University of Washington and since then, I've performed in plays in the Seattle area and I've also been a vocalist for Rise Up - The Hamilton Tribute Band.</p>
